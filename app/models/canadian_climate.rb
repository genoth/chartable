      description: "Seasonal average temperature deviations were computed for weather stations across Canada with sufficiently long data records to allow for trend calculation and were then interpolated to a 50-kilometre spaced grid. Seasonal grid points values were averaged together to produce a seasonal time series of temperature devations representing the entire country. Seasons are defined as winter (December, January, and February), spring (March, April, and May), summer (June, July, and August) and fall (September, October, and November).",
